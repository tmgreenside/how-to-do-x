## Security
### Overview
Security itself is a very broad topic, as it encapsulates every app, website, backend or anything else very created that can be seen. Understanding basic security concepts for different types of applications is essential to make a good app. For instance, when using a backend database it's very important to use prepared statements with parameters. Otherwise, information could be stolen from the database, which makes a frowny face.

### First Steps
Read!  
REad!  
REAd!  
READ!  
Listen!  
LISTEN!  
Everyone starts at the bottom of the totem pole; but we've all got to get started at some point!  
Great resources to read/listen from:  

- [Security Now](https://twit.tv/shows/security-now), is the best security podcast that discusses anything from updates in https, TLS and other things to recent hacks that have happened in the industry. Steve Gibson hosts this, with Leo creates more dialog. For a security podcast, it's quite entertaining!  
- [Krebs On Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/), is one of the best blogs that a person can stay up-to-date with. He's the first to know about security breaches and other things in the industry. He usually has great posts about every 3 days on something new.  
- [List of Blogs](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/best-internet-security-blogs/) This is a list of computer security blogs that all serve a valuable purpose. However,there are thousands of other blogs and people willing to talk about things! So, find what fits you.

If the path is just understanding how to build solid and secure applications then just repeat the above until the end of time. However, if you want to get into the security business there's much, much more to follow!  

### First Project  
The first step to do some hacking or security based project is understanding the technology quite well to start with. So, it's very vital to pick a technology that you consider yourself very familiar with. For the purpose of this, I will pick SQL(structured query language) because of how widely used it is. SQL a language used to store and access information in a unified way. Further knowledge can be found at: [Learning MYSQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-basic-mysql-tutorial) has a good description of how manipulate tables. Further, [Querying and More](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) teaches basic querying and things. For the purposes of this, and most things you'll ever need to do, just learn how to alter, create and delete tables. Then, understanding what SELECT, FROM, and WHERE are all capable of is enough. After understanding these few things, databases are simple.

#### Step 1
Setting up a database is very, very important in order to use a database! So, this is step 1. It's recommended that this is done on a unix-y system, like Linux or MAC.  
[Setup MySQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-14-04)
:does a great job at getting the database set up locally.

#### Step 2
For the sake of the project, let's use a login screen for this. So, a basic 'table' can be used for this, representing the application. In the table, we will only have two columns:
username and password. This implementation is in Python.
The table will simply look like:

| username | password   |
|----------|------------|
| theGUMan | 1233456789 |
| Spike    | Woof       |  

SQL for this table:
```
CREATE TABLE Login(
    username VARCHAR(50),
    password VARCHAR(200),
    PRIMARY KEY(username)
);
```

SQL Query for getting results:
```
SELECT username, password
FROM Login
WHERE username = 'variable_1' AND
password = 'variable_2';
```
The user needs to give variable_1 and variable_2 to check to see if the authentication works.  

Below is a Python script with how to create a basic login script for the user:

```
def login(username,password):
    #connections
    db = MySQLdb.connect(host="localhost",    # your host, usually localhost
                         user="root",         # your username
                         passwd="passwd",  # your password
                         db="user_fun") #database name

    cur = db.cursor() #crates the connection.
    query = """ #the actual query.
    SELECT *
    FROM Login
    WHERE user = "%s"
    AND password = "%s" ;
    """ % (username,password)

    cur.execute(query) # execute the query

    #Logging information.
    my_string = ""
    for row in cur.fetchall():
        my_string += row[0] + " " + row[1] + "\n"

    if(my_string != ""):
        print "Logged in"
    else:
        print "Failed!"
```

#### Step 3
Here's the fun part: time to just mess around, read around and have fun with it! So, now that the authentication process works, now what? Well, the schema above has some major issues with it...
- **Passwords**:  
Seem funky that the databases are stored by itself in plain text? Well, you were right! What happens in practice is what are called 'one-way hash functions' are used to encrypt the information. A one-way hash function is a way to jumble up data so that it's impossible to go back to the original value. This is used because it can be used to **validate** whether a password is correct, without the database actually storing the password.
- **Privileges**:  
Within databases, as in everything are different types of users, which can do different actions. By having different users with different privileges(ideally as low as possible) it can help with reducing the amount of damage caused by a hacker.
- **SQL Injections**:  
An SQL injection is a way to insert arbitrary code into the system, just with the user input. With this, it's possible to get not only the information initially asked for, but everything from the database! There are thousands of ways to get information out of a database like this! A basic SQL injection for the query `SELECT * FROM Login WHERE username = '%s' AND password = '%s'` where %s is the string being inserted into the query is putting `dummy' OR '1' OR '1`. This will then give the database `SELECT * FROM Login WHERE username = 'dumb' AND password = 'dummy' OR '1' OR '1'`, which will log the user in. Further, we can just use a comment, which is '--' in SQL, to escape the code. This goes on, and on and on! The way to fix this is to use **prepared statements** in the query instead of just plain text. Or, to do an input validation, such as removing all quotations or something like that.

### Step 4
Keep pushing the boundaries of how this authentication process works! Create a [timing based](https://github.com/mdulin2/Timing-Based-SQL-Injection) SQL injection or salt the passwords! The better you understand it, the better you're going to understand how another website might be set up. You'll also understand more about how to make your software more secure!

### What else?
This list is literally endless! There are websites dedicated to helping people learn how certain applications are vulnerable. There are an endless amount of podcasts and blogs that you could listen to, conferences to go to...  
- [Google Grueye](https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/)  
An awfully made web application that is meant to teach people about cross site scripting(XSS) and other issues.
- [Hack this site!](https://hackthissite.org)  
A website with a ton of tutorials and challenges ranging from impossible to beginner.  

### Projects
Personal Projects that can be done:

The hip thing right now! It's quite secure; so, understanding how this works would be a blessing!


## Desktop apps

## Video Games 

Building video game can be an incredibly fun way to get better at programming and it can also be a great artistic expression.

For the purposes of this section, we'll split up this section into two pieces based on intent. Both paths are respectable goals.

### I want to be a better programmer

If you're building games out of a desire to be a better programmer, this path is for you. 

You should build games without a graphical game engine. You're welcome to go down the OpenGL graphics route if you feel comfortable with C++, but this path will focus mainly on non-graphical games libraries.

Note that you will likely make worse games with this path.

#### Pick an Engine

There's typically game engines for every programming language, but here's some good ones for individual languages:

* Python: Pygame
* Java: LibGDX
* Ruby: Ruby2d
* Javascript: Phaserjs

#### A First Project

Start small. Your first project should be moving a block on the screen. Get a window opening. Get a block on the screen. See if you can get the block to move when you press arrow keys. 

### I want to make really good games

If you're building games mostly because you want to make games and the programming is more of a means to an ends, this path is for you. 

### Unity

#### A First Project

## Frontend Web

Web is weird. There's a whole lot to learn about it and it can be difficult to understand what to learn when.

This section is primarily about "frontend-only" or "static" sites. That is, they don't connect to a server or database you wrote. The code _only_ runs on the browser.

### First Steps - HTML 

The simplest website is just a file called `index.html` with some text in it:

```html
<!-- index.html (note that this is a comment and not actually needed) -->

hi there!
```

You may see other websites with things like `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the top. While important in real projects, they aren't required if you're just learning and you can ignore them for now. The browser will fill them in for you.

Open up your `index.html` file by double clicking on it. Your browser will run it without the need for a server. 

If you change your text now, you'll need to refresh your page. 

HTML is full of `tags` that label specific content. The most common ones are as follows:

```html
<h1> I make headers! </h1>
<h2> I make headers! </h2>
<h3> I make headers! </h3>
<h4> I make headers! </h4>
<h5> I make headers! </h5>

<p>I make a paragraph with a space afterwards.</p>

<a href="https://github.com">I'm a link!</a>

This is <b>BOLD</b>.
```

There are [a LOT of tags](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_html.asp) out there. Thankfully, they're well documented and there's millions of examples out there! If you see something on a website you want to do, just right click in your browser and "inspect element".

#### Adding style - CSS
TODO


#### Making it do things - Javascript


## Backend Web

###Steps
* Learn HTML
* Learn either JavaScript, Python, Java, or Go
* Learn to deploy (Nginx, Apache)

Building the backend of a website is fairly simple.  To start, you want to know how to write the pages our server will be delivering (HTML).  Next, you will need to create a simple server.  You have several options here.  Node.JS is a web framework written in JavaScript, is easy to set up, and is an excellent choice for your first web project.  Python offers two web servers: Flask and Django.  Flask is fairly similar to Node.  Another popular choice is Ruby on Rails.  This is less flexible then Node.JS, but it is simple, easy to use, and has a great support network.

To build websites, it helps to know how to use a database (MySQL, MongoDB, etc).  Without this, you will be fairly limited in terms of what your website is capable of.

## Building Programming Languages

### Overview

Building languages is not as hard as it may appear! In general, the key concepts are:

* [Grammars](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Programming_Languages/Grammars), or the formal structure of a language.
* Lexing, or the conversion of text into abstract "tokens" that can be used in the grammar. For example, most languages convert the `+` into a `PLUS` token.
* [Parsing](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Programming_Languages/Parsing), or the conversion of "tokens" (pieces of a language) into an [Abstract Syntax Tree](http://azu.github.io/slide/JSojisan/resources/ast-is-true.png).

### First Project

A good first project is to build a calculator that can compute things like this:

```
1 + 2 * 5
```
https://news.ycombinator.com/
#### Step 1: Write a grammar

You should probably write this in [EBNF form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form). It doesn't need to have the exact same syntax, but it's useful to understand the conventions.

To get you started, here's a partial grammar for the calculator:

```
add: add '+' add | NUM.
NUM: [0-9].

// TODO: Rest of the grammar
```

Notice that grammars are written as recursive "rules". In the example above, the string `1 + 2` would enter the `add` rule, then recurse till it matched the `NUM`.

#### Step 2: Write a lexer

The easiest way to do this is to use [regular expressions](https://regexr.com/). If you've never used regular expressions before or are generally scared of them, you're also welcome to parse out by iterating through characters.

Don't worry too much about doing it the "right" way at the moment, just focus on getting something working.

You'll typically define your tokens as an `enum` or your language's equivalent.

```javascript
enum Tokens = (
  PLUS,
  NUM
);

function lex(code) {
  let tokens = []

  // TODO: if parse out a '+'
  tokens.push(Tokens.PLUS)

  // TODO: if parse out a number
  tokens.push(Tokens.NUM)

  return tokens
}
```

#### Step 3: Write a parser

The common way to do this is with a [recursive descent parser](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2015/7/30/writing-a-simple-recursive-descent-parser.html). This is where your grammar will come in handy.

Your goal here is to create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which is just a tree of your grammar rules!

Each node of the tree should have two values, the type and an optional value.

For example:

```javascript
class Node {
  this.value;    // Any type
  this.type;     // A token or rule name
  this.children; // Other nodes
}
```

When complete, your tree will look a lot like your grammar:

```
# An example input
1 + 2

# An example lexed output
(NUM, 1) PLUS (NUM, 2)

# An example tree
add
  - NUM, 2
  - PLUS, nil
  - NUM, 2
```

The general way people do this is by creating a number of functions corresponding to their rules that "accept" a token and build the part of the tree.

You'll probably want a "look ahead" that checks the next token in the sequence.

```javascript
function add() {
  if (lookahead == Tokens.PLUS) {
    // TODO: add an `add` node to tree and recurse!
    add();
    plus();
    add();
    return;
  }

  // Otherwise, we're a number!
  num();
  return;
}

function num() {
  // TODO: add a num node to tree
  return;
}
```

#### Step 4: Build an interpreter

Now that we have an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), we can perform a [depth first search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/depth-first-search-or-dfs-for-a-graph/) and evaluate each node.

To start, let's give an example tree:

```
add
  - NUM 2
  - PLUS, nil
  - NUM 3
```

We typically build our interpreter similar to how we built our recursive descent parser; we build it with functions. Except this time, our functions can visit each child node and return a value.

For example:

```javascript
function visit(node) {
  // TODO: search down the tree until we get to a num and then return
  // that value
}

function visitAdd(node) {
  return visit(node.add[0]) + visit(node.add[0]);
}

function visitNum(node) {
  return node.value;
}
```

### Where to go from here

The world of programming languages is really, really big.

#### Compiler Compilers!

If you went through and built that recursive descent parser and found it to be a little tedious, you're in luck! There's options for auto-generating a recursive descent parser from a grammar.

* [Antlr](http://www.antlr.org/) is my personal favorite!
* [Yacc, Lex, and Bison](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/)

#### Formal grammars

Many bugs you've faced can come down to ambiguities in your grammar. Having a better understanding of the different types of grammars and parsers and how they're defined can really help you.

* [LL(n)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser)
* [LALR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LALR_parser)
* [PEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar)

### Example projects

#### A Portfolio Language

Build a language like markdown that creates portfolio websites for you!

#### Code Generators

Create an AST generator for an existing language and use that to generate code for the language.

#### AST Formatter

Create a formatter that takes an existing programming language, converts it to an AST, then reprints it the correct style.

#### Build a simple scripting language

Build another language in your favorite language! Add variables, functions, arrays, and more!
